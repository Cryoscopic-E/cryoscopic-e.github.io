          I'm currently studying a Msc in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.hw.ac.uk/">Heriot Watt University.</a>
          <br>
          This is an advanced and specialist program which is a blend of theoretical and applied studies.<br>
          This course focuses on learning and mastering multiple programming languages, in particular: C#, C, Java and
          Javascript.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started programming by learning C, while studying for my chemistry undergraduate, I learned and mastered C#
          and Java concurrently. <br>
          I've built games with Unity game engine, and also developed small android apps using these two languages. <br>
          My passion for Game Development pushed me to learn other game engines like: Godot and Phaser.js <br>
          Right now I'm using and learning Node.js for developing Web Applications. <br>
          I also like building things using the Arduino board.
